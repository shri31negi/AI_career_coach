# 🚀 AI Career Coach  

An **AI-powered career guidance application** built with **Streamlit, Scikit-learn, and PDFPlumber** that transforms static resumes into actionable insights. Instead of generic advice, it provides **personalized career guidance, skill gap analysis, and tailored roadmaps** based on your uploaded resume.

## 📌 Problem Statement  
In today’s fast-evolving tech landscape, students and early-career professionals often face challenges such as:  

- *Which tech role suits me based on my skills?*  
- *What should I learn or build next?*  
- *Am I industry-ready for my target role?*  
- *What projects and interview prep should I focus on?*  

While tools like ChatGPT give general advice, they don’t deeply understand an individual’s **resume context**. This project solves that.
